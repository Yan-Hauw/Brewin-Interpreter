# Brewin-Interpreter

For organization and cleanliness, this repository only contains the core code for the interpreter. Other code and notes like test cases, notes, and the framework that was used to run the interpreter are available but not included.

intbase.py contains code that was provided as a skeleton for evaluating the thoroughness and quality of the final version of the interpreter that was built.

The code that I wrote for the interpreter is in env_v3.py, func_v3.py, interpreter_v3.py, and tokenize.py. This code treats the code in intbase.py as a base class and extends it to create the interpreter.
